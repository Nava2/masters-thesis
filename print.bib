    abstract = {Hardware-based courses in computer science studies require much effort from both students and teachers. The most important part of students' learning is attending in person and actively working on laboratory exercises on hardware equipment. This paper deals with a specific group of students, those who are marginalized by not being able to regularly attend lessons and perform the laboratory exercises. This group of "busy students" includes older students, and those who travel, are employed or are parents. In particular it describes how such students achieved impressive results in a hardware-based course by using Open Educational Resources (OER). These facilitated students' learning process and gave busy students the opportunity to organize their learning time so as to work on the hardware courses remotely from home when they had time and opportunity. The results of the evaluation show significant improvements, both in grade distribution and course throughput, after implementing the new Open Educational Resources approach.},

The software component consists of a Java-like object-oriented programming language, Shelby, a full-fledged, transparent compiler with extensive tracing, logging, and inspection capabilities, and a runtime system for executing its programs. The hardware component is for designing and implementing conceptualized representations of embedded systems and computer architectures that support the software. The simulation component provides a flexible, interactive framework for running controlled experiments on the software and hardware. It provides students with raw data for quantitative performance analysis, evaluation, and reporting of their designs. ShelbySim also functions as an appealing tool for demonstrations and recruitment.},

    abstract = {TinyCPU is a small processor that can be im- plemented in various FPGAs that can be used for education and development of small embedded system. TinyCPU is so small that it is designed using Verilog HDL and the size of source code is only 427 lines. However, it does not support interrupts and peripheral controllers. The main contribution of this paper is to present TinyCSE (Tiny Computer System for Education), an extension of TinyCPU supporting interrupts and peripheral controllers. TinyCSE has controllers for exter- nal devices including keyboard, mouse, serial communication, switch, and timer. It also supports hardware interrupts from these external devices. Quite surprisingly, the code sizes of the CPU with interrupt controller and the device controllers are 515 lines and is 1339 lines in Verilog HDL, respectively. Our processor is portable and easy to understand and the function expansion is not difficult. As real-life applications, we have developed a time watch. This applications runs in 73MHz on the Xilinx Spartan-3AN family FPGA XC3S700AN using 832 out of 5888 slices (14.1{\%}). Therefore, our tiny processing system benefits computer system education and small embedded system development.},
