\section{ShelbySim \cite{Tappan2009}}

ShelbySim is an education-oriented software system for designing, simulating, and evaluating computer-engineering based applications. ShelbySim was designed surrounding a new Java-like programming language including a compiler explicitly built around providing extensive diagnostic information such as logging, tracing, and inspection capabilities. These tools provide students with raw data for quantitative analysis, evaluation and reporting of their designs. 

The software is open-source, though not available, and is written using Java allowing full operating system independent support. Additionally, 3D visualized results are provided for viewing developed components. ShelbySim is broken down into three subcomponents:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Software component - a custom programming language (Shelby), a compiler, and an interpretation runtime
\item Hardware component - filling a similar niche to MultiSim, but with tight integration with Shelby and its underlying tracing. Additional support exists for external component integration
\item Simulation component - providing a deterministic and stochastic approach for inputs into custom hardware versions
\end{enumerate} 

Provides evaluation criterion for students components and underlying systems. The simulated components have parameters that are modifiable through switches and sliders (e.g. \{on, off\} or a range from 0 - 100\%). This gives students metrics to evaluate their designs. Additionally, outputs are exported at runtime to Comma Separated Value (CSV) files allowing for more in-depth analysis with external programs such as Microsoft Excel or MATLAB. This gives a flexible and realistic testing environment for student learning. 

\subsubsection{Talking Points}

\begin{itemize}
\item Most software does not focus on pedagogy
\item Industry software hides underlying information (rightly so for them)
\item Visualization gives "less opaque" view of the system
\item Language 
\item Focuses on compiler semantics, low-level detail implementations (e.g. motor characteristics)
\end{itemize}

\section{CPUSim \cite{Skrien2001}}

CPU Sim is a Java CPU simulator written for use within a classroom environment. CPUSim allows students to design, modify, and compare various computer architectures at the register-transfer level and higher. Additionally, students may write and debug assembly code for custom architectures. The JavaFX front-end allows for viewing CPU internal components (e.g. RAMs and Registers) while stepping through programs. CPUSim allows students to encode and decode values through a user interface for machine codes. 

CPUSim also allows students to specify microinstructions that are combined to create full assembly-level instructions. This forces students to describe and think about what actions they need for their ``higher-level'' instructions. 

CPUSim's design is flexible given the Java-based system allowing students to work on multiple different platforms easily. Additionally, it is written such that many aspect of the software may be customized. Unfortunately, due to the decision to utilize the Java Virtual Machine, interfaces with lower-level components such as serial ports is difficult. 

\subsubsection{Talking Points}

\begin{itemize}
\item Java-based
\item Full-debugger
\item Specify microinstructions (microcodes) instead of assuming them
\item Code is older, tightly coupled and problematic
\item 
\end{itemize}

\section{EASE \cite{Skillen2011}}

\blockquote[Skillen2011]{Striking the right balance between teaching sufficient de-tails of hardware components and their working principles, and important theoretical concepts useful for programming the computer is always a challenge.}

Found most of the simulators in \cite{Nikolic2009} were inadequate for teaching simulation architecture courses, driving the work in EASE. Many were used for circuitry/RTL level work thus not good enough for project at hand. 

The following characteristics are most important: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Support of more than one architecture to illustrate CISC, RISC and URISC
\item Designed in a modular way to allow for extension of the simulation (adding new instructions)
\item Source code available
\item Portable
\end{enumerate}

All of which are now (or will be) fixed in future versions of CPUSim. The article compared approximately version 3.1 (\cite{Skrien2001}). 

Requires the following further improvements: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Add built-in editor
\item No provided documentation or samples
\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EASE vs. CPUSim}

Architectures are specified outside the simulation itself as a Java Library -- disconnected from the simulator/software itself. 

Architectures are bound to specific models that are specified by EASE, (e.g. CISC (similar to x86), RISC and a URISC). These are tightly coupled to EASE itself. 

Based on descriptions of the internal mechanics, it is tightly coupled to the current structure and not flexible in changing internals -- though, the source is not available. 


\subsection{Talking Points}

\begin{itemize}
\item Java-based
\item CPUSim is directly compared in this paper
\item No source available (yet claims it is..)
\item Dead-ware
\item Tightly coupled to specified architectures
\item Focuses on assembly in these architectures
\item Ships with URISC architecture (subleq)
\end{itemize}

\section{Survey/eval of simulators for teaching \cite{Nikolic2009}}

Mixture of discussion surrounding architectures and organization -- less on simulation of actual assembly-level programming.
