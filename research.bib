abstract = {In many universities, computer architecture is taught using traditional textbook-based methods. However, it is not easy for students to understand how computers work through lecture style courses alone. This paper describes an experiential approach for teaching masters-level advanced computer architecture with the assistance of hands-on laboratory sessions, leading students to implement performance-enhancing additions to a simple stack-based CPU called Tiny CPU originally designed by Nakano of Hiroshima University. From the teaching experience in Nan yang Technological University, analysed in this paper, students manage to quickly grasp the concepts of CPU operation, rapidly investigate the effects of adjusting CPU structure on program execution, and learn the skills-set necessary to enable them to built and improve custom processors later in their careers.},

@inproceedings{Nakamura2013,
abstract = {TinyCPU is a small processor that can be im- plemented in various FPGAs that can be used for education and development of small embedded system. TinyCPU is so small that it is designed using Verilog HDL and the size of source code is only 427 lines. However, it does not support interrupts and peripheral controllers. The main contribution of this paper is to present TinyCSE (Tiny Computer System for Education), an extension of TinyCPU supporting interrupts and peripheral controllers. TinyCSE has controllers for exter- nal devices including keyboard, mouse, serial communication, switch, and timer. It also supports hardware interrupts from these external devices. Quite surprisingly, the code sizes of the CPU with interrupt controller and the device controllers are 515 lines and is 1339 lines in Verilog HDL, respectively. Our processor is portable and easy to understand and the function expansion is not difficult. As real-life applications, we have developed a time watch. This applications runs in 73MHz on the Xilinx Spartan-3AN family FPGA XC3S700AN using 832 out of 5888 slices (14.1{\%}). Therefore, our tiny processing system benefits computer system education and small embedded system development.},

Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula IEEE Computer Society Association for Computing Machinery 2 Preface This document was developed through an effort originally commissioned by the ACM Education Board and the IEEE-Computer Society Educational Activities Board to create curriculum recommendations in several computing disciplines: computer science, computer engineering, software engineering and information systems. Other professional societies have joined in a number of the individual projects. Such was the case for the SE2004 (Software Engineering 2004) project, which included participation by representatives from the Australian Computer Society, the British Computer Society, and the Information Processing Society of Japan. SE2004 Development Process The SE2004 project was driven by a Steering Committee appointed by the sponsoring societies. The development process began with the appointment of the Steering Committee co-chairs and a number of the other participants in the fall of 2001. More committee members, including representatives from the other societies were added in the first half of 2002. The following are the members of the SE2004 Steering Committee:},
